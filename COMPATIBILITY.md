# Iroh wire compatibility

go-iroh is an independent Go implementation of iroh wire v1. This matrix records observed interoperability with real, pinned Rust iroh peers; unsupported cells are not compatibility claims.

Go-client↔Go-relay pairings contain no Rust peer, so they are outside this matrix's scope; that path is covered by the standard test suite.

Generated at 2026-08-19T22:36:17Z. A pass requires a recorded Rust process and binary digest; setup errors, unsupported cells, and untested cells never count as passes.

## How to read this table

- `pass` means the implementations interoperated in the observed scenario and matched the expected verdict.
- `fail (expected)` means the scenario ran, observed a wire incompatibility, and matched the expected verdict.
- `FAIL (unexpected)` or `PASS (unexpected)` means the observation disagreed with the expected verdict.
- `unsupported` means go-iroh lacks the feature, not that the feature is broken.
- `setup-error` means the environment could not run the scenario, so it makes no compatibility claim.
- `—` means the scenario was not run for that version.

Released columns are compatibility claims against a pinned Rust release. A `-pre` column is expected-enforced evidence against a pinned upstream commit, not a claim about a shipped version. The `tip` column is a moving, advisory signal refreshed nightly and is never a committed compatibility claim. Experimental rows may change wire format to track upstream without a major go-iroh version bump.

The Rust counterpart is either an **upstream CLI**, an unmodified program shipped by upstream iroh, or a **Rust test driver**, a purpose-built peer linked to the pinned upstream libraries. CLI results have the strongest black-box provenance; test-driver results cover protocol behavior that upstream CLIs do not expose.

Matrix cells reference the **Peers** table below. Each peer entry records the Rust executable and its SHA-256 digest. The machine-readable result also records the peer process ID, so a pass cannot be emitted without evidence of a real Rust process.

## Compatibility envelope

| Surface | Tier | Upstream train | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CustomAddr endpoint tickets | experimental | 1.0 | observed-incompatible | Observed with iroh-base 1.0.3 in both directions: upstream uses the legacy enum encoding. |
| CustomAddr endpoint tickets | experimental | 1.1 (pre-release pin) | verified-interop | Measured at upstream commit 4706ec97 in both directions. Upstream moved to go-iroh's length-prefixed byte format; no go-iroh codec change is required. |

The pinned 1.1-pre column currently exercises the bidirectional CustomAddr wire-vector suite in blocking CI. Other scenarios remain untested for that train until blocking coverage is explicitly expanded at its release re-pin. The `tip` column is populated only in the nightly advisory report.

## Scenario definitions

| Scenario | What a pass proves |
|---|---|
| discovery/go-publish-rust-dns | A Go client publishes a signed pkarr packet to the upstream Rust DNS server, and a pass proves that the server stores and returns the packet byte for byte. |
| discovery/qad-report | Go and upstream iroh-doctor probe the same network, and a pass proves that their QAD reports agree on shared reachability fields and satisfy address and latency invariants. |
| discovery/relay-urls | Go and the Rust test driver contact the same upstream relay URL, and a pass proves that both implementations resolve it, negotiate the relay protocol, and receive a pong. |
| discovery/rust-publish-go-dns | The Rust test driver publishes a signed pkarr packet to the Go DNS server, and a pass proves that the server stores and returns the packet byte for byte. |
| handshake/alpn-mismatch | A Go client offers the wrong ALPN to an upstream Rust server, and a pass proves that the incompatible handshake is rejected instead of silently connecting. |
| handshake/close-semantics | Go closes a connection to the Rust test driver with application code 42 and reason bye, and a pass proves that the Rust peer observes both values. |
| handshake/datagrams | Go and the Rust test driver exchange QUIC datagrams in both directions, and a pass proves compatible datagram framing and acknowledgement behavior. |
| handshake/go-client-rust-server | A Go client runs the doctor send, receive, and echo exchange against an upstream Rust server, and a pass proves compatible identity, ALPN, QUIC, and stream behavior. |
| handshake/pq-only | Go and Rust peers exchange data in both directions under a PQ-only policy, and a pass proves X25519MLKEM768 negotiation plus NoKxGroupsInCommon refusal of classical-only peers. |
| handshake/prefer-pq | Go and Rust peers exchange data in both directions while preferring post-quantum key exchange, and a pass proves that both negotiate X25519MLKEM768. |
| handshake/remote-info | Go and the Rust test driver exchange an authenticated stream and record peer addressing, and a pass proves that Go reports the Rust endpoint ID and a direct address. |
| handshake/rust-client-go-server | An upstream Rust client runs the doctor send, receive, and echo exchange against a Go server, and a pass proves compatible identity, ALPN, QUIC, and stream behavior. |
| handshake/wrong-endpoint-id | A Go client dials an upstream Rust server using the wrong endpoint ID, and a pass proves that peer authentication rejects the connection. |
| handshake/zero-rtt | A Go client resumes a Rust-issued TLS session and sends an early stream, and a pass proves that the Rust peer accepts the data as QUIC 0-RTT. |
| relay/go-client-rust-relay | A Go client authenticates to an upstream Rust relay and exchanges ping and pong frames, and a pass proves compatible relay protocol negotiation and framing. |
| relay/idle-timeout | A client leaves a TCP connection idle before WebSocket establishment on an upstream Rust relay, and a pass proves that the relay closes it after the expected timeout. |
| relay/ping-pong | A Go client sends an eight-byte relay ping to an upstream Rust relay, and a pass proves that the corresponding pong preserves the payload. |
| relay/rust-client-go-relay | The Rust test driver authenticates to a Go relay and exchanges ping and pong frames, and a pass proves that the Go relay accepts the upstream wire protocol. |
| relay/rust-client-rust-relay | The Rust test driver authenticates to an upstream Rust relay and exchanges ping and pong frames, and a pass proves that the pinned control path is operational. |
