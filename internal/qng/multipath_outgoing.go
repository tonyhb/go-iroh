// This file is the X1 Stage 5f send-side multipath orchestration
// (draft-ietf-quic-multipath): opening a second PathID, validating it with a
// PATH_CHALLENGE/PATH_RESPONSE exchange, and scheduling 1-RTT sends over it.
//
// It is deliberately separate from path_manager_outgoing.go, which is the RFC
// 9000 single-path connection-MIGRATION manager (the int64 pathID concept that
// switches the active 4-tuple and discards the old one). Multipath keeps BOTH
// paths alive: PathIDZero never stops carrying data, and a non-zero path is an
// additional, independent number space + congestion controller (5a) addressed
// by its own connection IDs (5c). Nothing here touches pathManagerOutgoing.
//
// Threading: every field of multipathOutgoing is owned by the connection's run
// goroutine. The sentPacketHandler / receivedPacketHandler / connIDGenerator
// have no locks and are read by the packer on every 1-RTT packet, so opening a
// path from an application goroutine would race them (confirmed with -race).
// Conn.OpenPath therefore only enqueues an openPathRequest; the run loop
// performs the actual provisioning in processOpenPathRequests.

// ErrPathLimit is returned by OpenPath when the peer has not yet advertised a
// large enough MAX_PATH_ID, or when the requested path would exceed the local
// limit. The condition can be transient immediately after handshake completion,
// while the peer's MAX_PATH_ID frame is still in flight.
