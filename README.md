# go-iroh

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/tmc/go-iroh.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/tmc/go-iroh)

`go-iroh` is a Go implementation of [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh).
It provides peer-to-peer QUIC
endpoints identified by ed25519 public keys, with direct paths, relay fallback,
QUIC Retry, multipath, QAD observed addresses, and QNT NAT traversal support,
plus Rust-compatible ports of the iroh protocol stack: blobs, gossip, and docs.

The module is a clean-room Go port targeting wire compatibility with upstream
Rust iroh. It is not affiliated with the n0 team.

Wire compatibility and Go API stability are separate promises. The wire
protocol tracks pinned upstream releases; the Go API is not stable before v1
and may change in any v0 release.

## Packages

Connectivity layer:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `iroh` | Endpoint, Conn, Router, address lookup |
| `key` | endpoint IDs, Ed25519 keys, signatures |
| `netaddr` | endpoint addresses, transport addresses, relay URLs |
| `dns` | pkarr TXT encoding and stdlib/DoH/DoT lookupers |
| `pkarr` | pkarr signed DNS packet codec |
| `relay` | public relay maps and relay configuration |
| `relayserver` | embeddable relay server (backs `cmd/iroh-relay`) |
| `dnsserver` | embeddable DNS and pkarr server (backs `cmd/iroh-dns-server`) |
| `metrics` | small OpenMetrics registry |
| `watch` | small generic watch values |

Protocols (Rust-compatible ports):

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `blobs` | content-addressed blob tickets, identifiers, blob stores, and BAO transfer |
| `gossip` | iroh-gossip pub/sub mesh (HyParView membership, PlumTree broadcast) |
| `docs` | iroh-docs multi-writer key-value documents and range sync |
| `endpointticket` | Rust-compatible endpoint ticket codec |
| `irpc` | postcard-framed RPC helpers for iroh streams |
| `postcard` | Rust-compatible postcard wire codec (shared with sibling modules) |
| `quicconn` | adapts iroh connections to a QUIC-like surface |

Commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `cmd/iroh` | utility for iroh identities and addresses (keys, endpoint info) |
| `cmd/iroh-relay` | small, self-hostable relay server |
| `cmd/iroh-dns-server` | pkarr HTTP and DNS server for discovery |
| `cmd/wasmrelaytest` | browser smoke test for the js/wasm relay-only transport |

The transport internals live under `internal/`: relay protocol/client/server,
net reports, socket path management, RFC 7250 TLS, the postcard and pkarr
implementations, the gossip proto state machine, and `qng`, the quic-go fork
used for iroh/noq compatibility.

## Ecosystem

| Repository | Contents |
|---|---|
| [go-iroh-examples](https://github.com/tmc/go-iroh-examples) | 40+ runnable example programs, from hello-world dial-up to gossip meshes |
| [go-iroh-tools](https://github.com/tmc/go-iroh-tools) | command-line tools built on go-iroh |
| [go-iroh-experiments](https://github.com/tmc/go-iroh-experiments) | experimental modules layered on go-iroh |

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/tmc/go-iroh
```

This module currently declares Go 1.26 in `go.mod`.

## Use

The `iroh` package is the main entry point:

```go
ep, err := iroh.Bind(ctx, iroh.WithALPNs("example/1"))
if err != nil {
	return err
}
defer ep.Shutdown(ctx)

conn, err := ep.Connect(ctx, peerAddr, "example/1")
if err != nil {
	return err
}
defer conn.CloseWithError(0, "")
```

ALPN means Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation. It is the TLS extension that
lets peers agree which application protocol a QUIC connection will carry, such
as `"example/1"` or `"n0/iroh/transfer/example/1"`. go-iroh uses ALPN values to
route incoming connections to handlers.

The API takes ALPN values as Go strings. TLS ALPN values are byte strings on the
wire; Go strings preserve arbitrary bytes, while keeping the common printable
ASCII case simple.

See [iroh/example_test.go](./iroh/example_test.go) for runnable direct-loopback
Router and Endpoint examples.

## Wire Compatibility

Relay, pkarr, DoH, and DoT connections use standard WebPKI TLS. Direct
peer-to-peer QUIC uses TLS 1.3 Raw Public Keys (RFC 7250) with mutual endpoint
authentication. Go's standard `crypto/tls` does not support RFC 7250, so this
repository carries `internal/itls/tls` and drives it from `internal/qng`.

`internal/qng` is a quic-go v0.59.1 fork extended for the iroh/noq transport
surface: multipath, QAD observed-address reporting, QNT NAT traversal, and
pre-connection QUIC Retry admission. The fork-local READMEs document when those
forks can be removed.

## Validation

Run the local suite:

```sh
go test ./...
```

For a repeatable local check:

```sh
go test ./... -count=1
```

Run the focused wire-parser fuzz targets for one minute each:

```sh
go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzReadObserveItem$' -fuzztime 1m ./blobs
go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzUnmarshal$' -fuzztime 1m ./internal/postcard
go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzFromBytes$' -fuzztime 1m ./internal/pkarr
go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzParseRelayFrames$' -fuzztime 1m ./internal/relayproto
go test -run '^$' -fuzz '^FuzzKeyMaterialClientAuthHeader$' -fuzztime 1m ./internal/relayproto
```

For loopback stream/datagram latency and throughput, with raw TCP and UDP
baselines:

```sh
GOMAXPROCS=4 go test ./iroh -run '^$' -bench 'Benchmark(Conn|RawTCP|RawUDP)' -benchtime=5s -count=5
```

`BenchmarkRawUDPMagicQueuedPingPong` is the closest raw UDP latency baseline for
the magic-socket path: it uses the same receive queue depth, pooled receive
buffers, caller-buffer copy, and separate write queue shape as the direct IP
transport.

Live Rust interop runs through the compatibility harness on the
[`compat-harness`](https://github.com/tmc/go-iroh/tree/compat-harness) branch,
which drives unmodified upstream iroh binaries in pinned Docker images against
go-iroh and renders [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md). It requires only Go
and Docker:

```sh
git checkout compat-harness
cd iroh-compat-harness && make parity
```

## Status

The connectivity layer is a wire-compatible iroh endpoint. The protocol packages
(`blobs`, `gossip`, `docs`) port the corresponding Rust crates, sharing the
`postcard` and `pkarr` wire codecs; `gossip` carries the full HyParView and
PlumTree state machine with a postcard discovery channel.

The normal local suite covers the public packages, qng transport extensions, and
local relay/direct behavior. Live Go↔Rust coverage — handshakes, transport
semantics, relay, discovery, and gossip against pinned upstream releases — runs
in the [compatibility harness](https://github.com/tmc/go-iroh/tree/compat-harness/iroh-compat-harness)
and is summarized in [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md).

GOOS=js/GOARCH=wasm builds compile. Browser runtime support is limited by the
platform: the relay WebSocket client has a js-specific dial path, but direct UDP
QUIC, direct paths, and NAT traversal are not available in browser WebAssembly.
